## Web3 Example Projects

This repository contains a series of Web3 example code covering frontend, smart contracts, and backend, aimed at helping developers quickly learn and apply them to real-world projects. We provide example code for various common scenarios.

## Running Locally

### Frontend

The frontend code is located in the `frontend` directory. Before running, please ensure the following preparations:

1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and complete the configuration information.
2. Apply for at least one API Key on [alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).

Next, install dependencies and start the project:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
### Smart Contracts

The smart contract code is located in the `contract` directory. Before running, please ensure the following preparations:

1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and complete the configuration information.
2. Apply for at least one Project Key on [infura](https://www.infura.io/).

Then, you can use `truffle` for smart contract development.
